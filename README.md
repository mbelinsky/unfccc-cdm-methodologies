# UNFCCC CDM Methodologies to Python Scripts

This repository contains Python scripts that transform UNFCCC Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) methodologies from static PDFs into functional, executable Python code. These methodologies are crucial for quantifying emission reductions and removals, enabling transparent and standardized calculations related to carbon credits and climate projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PDFMiner.six
- Pandas
- NumPy

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
> git clone https://github.com/mbelinsky/unfccc-cdm-methodologies.git
2. Install the required Python packages:
> pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage

1. Place the PDF files of CDM methodologies in the associated `methodology reference number + name + version` directory.
2. Run the script to convert PDFs to Python scripts.
3. Place the Python script in associated directory.
